ODE-NAR G2P Map
Interactive Evolutionary Dynamics Simulator
This app simulates the evolution of a population where an ODE-NAR system controls the G2P map By adjusting the parameters on the left, you can explore how different factors od the ODE influence the fitness landscape and the distribution of phenotypes within the population.

How it works:
Desired Phenotype: The optimal phenotype value that yields the highest fitness.
Population Size: The number of individuals in each generation.
Generations: The number of cycles of selection to simulate.
Alpha Range: The range of alpha values (decay rates) to consider.
Beta Range: The range of beta values (production rates) to consider.
The 3D plot shows the fitness landscape as a surface, with the current population represented by red points. You can interact with the plot by rotating and zooming to get different perspectives on the data.
